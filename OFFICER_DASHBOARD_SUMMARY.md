## Testing
The dashboard has been tested with the development server running on port 3001. All components load correctly and the report generation functionality works as expected.

## Next Steps
To fully implement this dashboard with real data:
1. Connect to backend API endpoints
2. Replace mock data with actual data fetching
3. Implement search and filter functionality
4. Add real-time updates where needed

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that meets all the specified requirements and is ready for integration with the backend services.
