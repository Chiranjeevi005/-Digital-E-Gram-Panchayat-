# Hero Section Button Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the HeroSection component to update the main buttons on the home page.

## Changes Made

### Before
- Button 1: "Access Services" (navigated to `/dashboard`)
- Button 2: "Explore Services" (navigated to `/services`)

### After
- Button 1: "Explore Services" (navigates to `/services`)
- Button 2: "Contact Us" (navigates to `/contact`)

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
`frontend/src/components/HeroSection.tsx`

### Code Changes

1. **First Button**:
   - Changed text from "Access Services" to "Explore Services"
   - Updated navigation destination from `/dashboard` to `/services`
   - Kept the same authentication logic (uses `handleCtaClick` function)

2. **Second Button**:
   - Changed text from "Explore Services" to "Contact Us"
   - Changed from a button with onClick handler to a Next.js Link component
   - Updated navigation destination to `/contact`
   - No authentication required for contact page

### Technical Implementation

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 sm:gap-6 animate-fade-in-up animation-delay-400">
  <button 
    onClick={() => handleCtaClick('/services')}
    className="btn-primary text-center flex-1"
  >
    Explore Services
  </button>
  <Link href="/contact" className="btn-secondary text-center flex-1">
    Contact Us
  </Link>
</div>
```

## Reasoning

1. **Consistency**: Both buttons now have clear, action-oriented text
2. **User Flow**: 
   - "Explore Services" directs users to browse available services
   - "Contact Us" provides a direct path to reach out to the Panchayat
3. **Simplicity**: Contact page doesn't require authentication, so we use a direct Link
4. **Accessibility**: Both buttons maintain the same styling and responsive behavior

## Testing

The changes have been implemented and are ready for testing:
1. Visit the home page at `http://localhost:3001`
2. Verify the button text has been updated
3. Test both buttons to ensure they navigate to the correct pages
4. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Files Affected

1. `frontend/src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Main implementation file
2. No other files were modified as part of this change

## Dependencies

This change depends on:
1. The Contact page being available at `/contact` (already implemented)
2. The Services page being available at `/services` (existing functionality)
3. The existing authentication logic in the `handleCtaClick` function
